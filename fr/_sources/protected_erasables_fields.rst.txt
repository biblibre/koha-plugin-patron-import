Protected and erasables fields
==============================

This page is accessible by clicking on `“Protected/erasables”` of your
import in the configuration page.

Protected fields
----------------

Field protection prevents fields from being changed with a new value when updating a patron.
The protection feature only affects the update.

Note that only a non blank value can erase a field when updating.

Erasable fields
---------------

Erasure is the opposite of protecting. If want you want to force a blank incoming field to update the Koha field, so set the field as erasable.
